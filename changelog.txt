= Version 1.28 / 1.21, 19.07.2025
   * [Fixed] Ethernet RX handling under high network load (NXP SDK)
     A non-intrusive workaround has been implemented to avoid modifying
     "ENET_GetRxFrameSize". The issue where "rxBdRing->rxGenIdx" pointed
     to an empty descriptor while valid RX frames were present in subsequent
     descriptors has been resolved. Forward-scan logic has been added to
     locate and update rxBdRing->rxGenIdx to the first occupied RX descriptor,
     thereby preventing erroneous RxFrameEmpty results.
     The fix was verified using tcpreplay to generate 100 MBit throughput.
   * Furthermore, the "low_level_input" function has been updated to now
     correctly account for defective frames.
